The attending (s) personally supervised the trainee during any key components of the procedure where applicable and reviewed and agrees with the findings as reported below. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 300mcg of fentanyl and 7.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 7 hours and 58 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1% lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: 4 mg intravenous tPA delivered through TIPS sheath CONTRAST: 235 ml of Optiray contrast FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 184.6 minutes, 2710 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Right internal jugular venous access using ultrasound. 2. Pre-procedure right atrial pressure measurements 3. Percutaneous transhepatic access into the TIPS stent. 4. Retrograde snaring of the percutaneous access into the right IJ 5. Trans jugular approach direct access into the upper portion of the pre-existing TIPS stent 6. Cone beam CT of the TIPS and portal venous system prior to placement of the new direct TIPS into the pre-existing TIPS 7. Placement of a 10 mm x 6 cm + 2 cm Viatorr partially-covered stent 8. Post-stenting balloon angioplasty of the TIPS shunt and portal vein with a 10 mm balloon. 9. Post-stenting portal venograms. 10. Extension of the cranial portion of the new portosystemic shunt (DIPS) using a 12 x 40 x 75 lumenneX stent _ _ _. Aspiration thrombectomy of the main portal vein and TIPS stent using a penumbra device- CAT 8 system 12. TPA administration via the TIPS sheath 13. Gel-Foam pledget tract embolization of the percutaneous transhepatic TIPS access 14. Placement of a tPA infusion catheter into the portal vein / SMV for resistant clot 15. A double-lumen PICC was placed via patent right basilic vein PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient.\n"
